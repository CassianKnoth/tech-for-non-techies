            Koalas are native to the eucalyptus forests and woodlands of eastern and southeastern Australia, thriving in the dense canopies of states such as Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. These forests provide not only their primary food source—eucalyptus leaves—but also essential shelter, protection from predators, and a stable environment for breeding and raising young. Koalas are highly specialized to their habitat, preferring certain species of eucalyptus trees over others, with each region’s population adapting to the specific varieties available in their ecosystem.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Living high in the treetops, koalas rely on their sharp claws and strong limbs to grip onto branches as they move between trees, often leaping short distances with surprising agility. Their arboreal lifestyle helps them avoid ground-dwelling predators such as dingoes and large pythons, while also reducing their exposure to extreme heat on the forest floor. However, despite their well-adapted nature, koalas face growing threats due to habitat loss. Deforestation, land clearing for agriculture and urban development, and the increasing frequency of bushfires have significantly reduced the size and quality of their natural environment. As tree canopies shrink, koalas are forced to travel on the ground in search of food and shelter, putting them at greater risk of predation, vehicle collisions, and other dangers.

        <p class="article__paragraph">
            Conservation efforts are now more crucial than ever to protect and restore koala habitats. Wildlife corridors, reforestation projects, and legal protections aim to ensure these marsupials continue to have access to the eucalyptus forests they depend on. Understanding the vital role of their habitat is key to preserving this beloved species for future generations.
